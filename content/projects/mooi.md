This project was born as a collab with a fellow designer, we were both in the same school. I was in charge of the development, which in the beginning just encapsulated a static website.

Later on, the client was so happy that she asked if we could make the content editable. So I turned into a Wordpress Custom Theme.

I used tools such as Advanced Custom Fields PRO, Custom Navigation and the Instagram API.
